I love my iPad!

In March 2019 I bought an iPad Pro 10.5" I found on ebay. It has become part of my everyday tech-carry since than.
I often don't even take my MacBook with me anymore!

Recently I bought the Smart Keyboard Folio, to get the most out of the device and have some kind of wholesome iPad experience.
Okay - only missing the Cellular option, but who needs that if you are in Wifi most of the time and
carry your iPhone with you all the time.

With the iPad I can read papers and mark important parts, do research online, use facetime or skype (with a better front camera than even the newest MacBooks) or simply surf the web in comfortable positions.

Now with the keyboard, I am able to write mails, notes for papers or even Blog-Posts easily (Like this one here, which I am writing on my iPad right now). What I mostly love about the keyboard is the fact that it enables you to still use all positions the smart cover allows. You can hide the Keyboard in the back of the ipad and even use "studio" position. Awesome! And all of that with a third of the weight of my MacBook Pro. Dear MacBook, prepare to be a stationary home computer.

Here is my iPad Pro line-up:
- iPad Pro 64 GB, bought used with case and Smart Cover at 30 battery cycles in March 2019
- Apple Pencil, bought used, brand-new in March 2019
- Apple Smart Keyboard for iPad Pro, bought used in September 2019 in mint condition and in exchange for the Smart Cover
